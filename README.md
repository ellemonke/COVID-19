2.	Maps COVID-19 “hotspots” and compares them to airport locations.
3.	Debunks some early myths about risk factors related to COVID-19. 

## Tech Stack
- Data analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy) and web API requests
- Visualizations using Matplotlib, Leaflet.js and D3.js
- Front-end web development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

## Potential Future Development
- Effect of Health Expenditure on Fatality Rate
- Risk Assessment for Africa, India 
- Reduce dependencies:
    1. Replace need for [CSV to GeoJSON Converter](https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm) with Python or JavaScript.
