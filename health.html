              <p>When looking at the number of confirmed cases, one might consider population density. Confirmed cases in this chart
                were baselined at 21 days from the first confirmed case, after the disease had some time to spread. There does not seem
                to be a relationship between population density and the number of confirmed cases. The outlier in the lower right is 
                Singapore; the outlier in the upper left is the U.S.</p>

              <img src="static/images/scatter_ncds.png" />
              <p>Prior health conditions, or Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs), are also believed to affect the severity of COVID-19,
                putting one's mortality at risk. NCDs are measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) or the number of years lost
                to an NCD (country total). Fatality rate does not seem to be driven by NCDs. The outlier in the upper left is the
                Philippines.</p>

              <img src="static/images/scatter_age.png" />
              <p>Another early belief about COVID-19 was that it was particularly fatal for seniors. However, when comparing the
                senior population of countries (ages 70+) it does not correlate with a country's fatality rate. Senior age does not
                necessarily determine one's ability or inability to overcome a disease such as COVID-19.</p>
                <!-- Other factors might
                affect fatality rate of a country more directly than age, such as social distancing or hospitalization prior to death. -->

              <!-- <h4>Respiratory Disease</h4> -->
              <img src="static/images/scatter_resps.png" />
              <p>Respiratory disease is a type of NCD. Based on the most severe symptoms of COVID-19, it seems to attack the lungs.
                People with weak respiratory systems might seem to be at a higher risk of fatality from COVID-19. However, this early
                data does not show a clear relationship between respiratory disease and COVID-19 fatality rates. The outliers in the 
                lower right are India and China.</p>
